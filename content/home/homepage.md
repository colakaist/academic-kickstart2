Soft matter and biological physics share a close relationship within the realm of physics due to the substantial presence of soft matter systems within various components of biological cells and tissues. Employing theoretical models and computer simulations, our research team primarily dedicates itself to unraveling the fundamental physical mechanisms governing biological systems across scales ranging from the molecular to the cellular level. This encompasses an exploration of free energy landscapes and the dynamics of conformational changes in polymer complexes. Additionally, our interests encompass the simulation and modeling of electrolytes, with a specific focus on deciphering the intricate mechanisms underpinning ion transport.

Presently, our research pursuits encompass several noteworthy areas. These include the structural and functional examination of membrane proteins, the characterization of the functional and mechanical attributes of soft matter within biological contexts, the exploration of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and their role in drug delivery, as well as investigations into electrolytes pertinent to lithium-ion transport and material design.
