abstract: "Standard QCD sum-rule analyses of the nucleon mass give results that are inconistent with chiral perturbation theory due to an overly simple continuum ansatz on the phenomenological side of the sum rule. We show that a careful treatment of the continuum, including Ï€-N states and other states with virtual pions, resolves the inconsistency associated with chiral logs."
