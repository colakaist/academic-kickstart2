abstract: "g KN Λ and g KN Σ are calculated using a QCD sum rule motivated method used by Reinders, Rubinstein, and Yazaki to extract hadron couplings to Goldstone bosons. The SU (3) symmetry breaking effects are taken into account by including the contributions from the strange quark mass and assuming different values for the strange and the up-down quark condensates. We find g KN Λ/√ 4π=-1.96 and g KN Σ/√ 4π= 0.33."
