abstract: "We report a project to provide a set of free source codes for lattice QCD. The programs may be used as fundamental blocks when one wants to construct his/her own QCD codes. They are written in Fortran 90 with use of MODULE, so that algorithms can transparently be seen. MPI is used for parallelization. We are also constructing a proto-type of QCD-GRID where one can try to run the code."
