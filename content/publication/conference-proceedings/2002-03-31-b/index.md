abstract: "We study relativistic charmonium on very fine quenched lattices (β = 6.4 and 6.6). We concentrate on the calculation of the hyperfine splitting between ηc and J/ψ, aiming for a controlled continuum extrapolation of this quantity. Results for the ηc and J/ψ wave functions are also presented."
