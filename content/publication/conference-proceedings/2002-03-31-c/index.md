abstract: "Responses to chemical potential of the pseudoscalar meson screening mass and the chiral condensate in lattice QCD are investigated. On a 16 × 82 × 4 lattice with two flavors of staggered quarks the first and second responses below and above Tc are evaluated. Different behavior in the low and the high temperature phases are observed, which may be explained as a consequence of the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration."
