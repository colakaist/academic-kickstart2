abstract: "We report N* masses in the spin-3 2 sector from a highly-improved anisotropic action. States with both positive and negative parity are isolated via a parity projection method. The extent to which spin projection is needed is examined. The gross features of the splittings from the nucleon ground state show a trend consistent with experimental results at the quark masses explored."
