abstract: "Responses of screening mass of the pseudoscalar meson and chiral condensate in lattice QCD are investigated. On a 16× 8^ 2× 4 lattice with two flavors of staggered quarks the first and second responses below and above T_C are evaluated. Different behavior in the low and the high temperature phases are presented, which may be explained as a consequence of the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration."
