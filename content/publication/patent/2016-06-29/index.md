abstract: "Disclosed are an apparatus and a method for managing a query about an E-book. The apparatus for managing a query about an E-book comprises: a generation unit for generating identification information on a query part in an E-book, for which a query request is made, in response to the query request for the E-book from the first terminal; an interface unit for receiving query content from the first terminal through a text field included in the E-book; and a processor for registering the query content in an internet bulletin board by matching the query content with the identification information and transmitting a notification of the registration to the first terminal and a second terminal of a group to which the first terminal belongs. The apparatus of the present invention enables learners to share the query content through access to the internet bulletin board."
