In order to understand mechanisms of various biological functions it is crucial to identify functional and mechanical properties of each biological component, such as an alpha-helix, a beta-sheet, DNA, a membrane, and so on. We have been developing continuum as well as elastic models of those components to indentify their mechanical properties(e.g., a persistence length or bending energy).
