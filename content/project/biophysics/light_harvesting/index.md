The field of light-harvesting delves into the investigation of materials and molecules that seize photons from solar light. This encompasses endeavors to gain deeper insights into the light-capturing attributes of photosynthetic organisms, as well as the construction of artificial systems intended to facilitate photochemical reactions. Within both natural and synthetic photosynthesis, energy transfer stands out as a pivotal process.

The constituents responsible for light-harvesting in photosynthetic organisms are intricate quantum systems involving multiple components. Specialized complexes formed by pigments and proteins convert sunlight into electronic excitations that are conveyed to reaction centers. There exists evidence suggesting that quantum coherence among electronically excited states assumes a vital function in energy transfer. Nevertheless, the precise relevance of coherent dynamics in the context of light-harvesting remains somewhat ambiguous.

Our focus revolves around formulating a Hamiltonian model that characterizes the excitation energy transfer occurring between pigment-protein complexes within photosynthesis. This entails identifying the indispensable elements that drive energy transfer. Our ultimate aim is to pinpoint coherent energy transfer mechanisms and leverage these insights to enhance other light-driven processes. The outcomes of our investigations could potentially serve as a foundation for devising efficient photonic devices geared towards light-harvesting.
