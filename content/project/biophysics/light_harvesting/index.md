The field of light-harvesting focuses on studying materials and molecules that capture photons from solar light. This includes efforts to gain deeper insights into the light-capturing properties of photosynthetic organisms, as well as the development of artificial systems designed to facilitate photochemical reactions. In both natural and synthetic photosynthesis, energy transfer plays a crucial role.

The components responsible for light-harvesting in photosynthetic organisms are complex quantum systems involving multiple elements. Specialized complexes formed by pigments and proteins convert sunlight into electronic excitations, which are then transferred to reaction centers. Evidence suggests that quantum coherence among electronically excited states plays a critical role in energy transfer. However, the exact significance of coherent dynamics in light-harvesting remains unclear.

Our focus is on developing a Hamiltonian model that describes the excitation energy transfer between pigment-protein complexes in photosynthesis. This involves identifying the key elements driving energy transfer. Our ultimate goal is to uncover coherent energy transfer mechanisms and apply this knowledge to improve other light-driven processes. The results of our research could provide a foundation for creating efficient photonic devices for light-harvesting applications.
