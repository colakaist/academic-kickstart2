Understanding the functional and mechanical properties of fundamental structures, such as peptides, DNAs, and membranes (whether bilayer or monolayer), is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that govern various biological functions at the molecular level. Our efforts have focused on developing theoretical models for these structures, enabling us to explore their mechanical properties as well as the interactions between these distinct entities.
