It is crucial to identify basic structures' functional and mechanical properties, such as peptides, DNAs, and membranes(bilayer or monolayer), to understand mechanisms of various biological functions at molecular scales. We have been developing theoretical models of these structures to investigate their mechanical properties and interactions between those structures.
