Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) possess the remarkable ability to deliver pharmacologically active compounds—such as proteins, plasmid DNA, liposomes, and nanoparticles—into cells, offering a promising avenue for future therapeutic applications. However, the exact pathways underlying their cellular uptake remain a subject of ongoing debate. Our research focuses on studying multiple CPPs to uncover their unique transport mechanisms and shed light on their interactions with various lipid molecules.
