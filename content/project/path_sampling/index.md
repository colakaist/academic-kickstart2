Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation has been known for a powerful and a flexible path sampling technique. It can handle various complex systems either in equilibrium or out of equilibrium, and at scales from molecular to cellular level. We have been using this technique to investigate conformational changes of various membrane proteins.
